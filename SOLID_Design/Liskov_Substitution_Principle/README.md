# Liskov Substitution Principle

This principle basically says that ANY method that works for a particular class should also work with any class that extends that class.

For example if a method takes a rectangle class, it should also take a square class (because squares are rectangles), and it should work exactly as expected with the square as it did with the rectangle.

I won't show code here. This is pretty straightforward to understand.
